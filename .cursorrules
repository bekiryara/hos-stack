You are working in a governance-first WP-based repository.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- DO NOT run any git commands (no checkout/branch/commit/push/pull/merge/rebase).
- DO NOT change branches.
- Only edit files explicitly listed in the prompt.
- Minimal diff only. No refactor. No new features unless the WP explicitly requires it.
- If a git action is required, output the exact commands for the human to run.
- Use existing ops scripts (ship_main, github_sync_safe) and existing docs; do not create new workflows, branches, or publishing methods.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Always return: (1) list of files created/changed, (2) next manual steps for the human.
