## WP-15: Runtime Truth + Frontend Readiness Lock

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**SPEC Reference:** §23 (productization start criteria), §24 (world status contract), §21 (patlama risk checklist), §20 (Account Portal read aggregation)

### Purpose
Lock runtime truth and make frontend integration deterministic without adding new business features. Provide a single source of truth for stack bring-up and readiness verification.

### Deliverables
- `docs/CURRENT.md` - Updated with runtime truth (health checks, contract checks, Account Portal endpoints, frontend readiness conditions)
- `ops/wp15_frontend_readiness.ps1` - Deterministic readiness check script
- `docs/PROOFS/wp15_frontend_readiness_pass.md` - Proof document with real outputs

### Commands
```powershell
# Frontend readiness check (deterministic)
.\ops\wp15_frontend_readiness.ps1

# Expected: PASS: READY FOR FRONTEND INTEGRATION (exit code 0)
# OR: FAIL: NOT READY (exit code 1) with specific failure details

# Health checks (from CURRENT.md)
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/world/status
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/worlds
curl http://localhost:8080/api/world/status

# Contract checks
.\ops\pazar_spine_check.ps1
.\ops\order_contract_check.ps1
.\ops\messaging_contract_check.ps1
```

### PASS Evidence
- `docs/PROOFS/wp15_frontend_readiness_pass.md` - Contains real script output showing deterministic readiness check
- `docs/CURRENT.md` - Updated with runtime truth (health checks, contract checks, frontend readiness conditions)
- Script returns exit code 0/1 deterministically based on contract check results

### Notes
- No new business features added
- No DB migrations
- No refactors
- Only: docs + ops verification scripts
- Script uses PowerShell 5.1 compatible syntax, ASCII-only output, does not close terminal (Read-Host at end)
